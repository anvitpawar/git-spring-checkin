📌 Slide 2: Introduction

What is Email Classification?
	•	Sorting and categorizing emails automatically.
	•	Reducing manual effort and response time.

Why is it Important?
	•	Businesses receive thousands of emails daily.
	•	Manual sorting is slow, error-prone, and inefficient.
	•	AI can streamline email processing and improve productivity.

Use Case: Consumer Loans & Banking Services
	•	Automating classification of customer requests.
	•	Prioritizing high-impact emails.
	•	Identifying duplicate or similar emails.

📌 Slide 3: Problem Statement

Challenges in Traditional Email Processing
	•	📌 Unstructured Data: Emails and attachments vary in format.
	•	📌 Time-Consuming: Manual triaging slows response times.
	•	📌 Duplication Issues: Similar emails create redundancy.
	•	📌 Lack of Prioritization: Urgent requests get mixed with low-priority ones.

Visual: A side-by-side comparison of manual vs AI-based email classification.
